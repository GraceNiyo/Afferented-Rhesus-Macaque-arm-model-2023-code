This library has the supplementary codes for  "An α-MN collateral to γ-MNs can mitigate velocity-dependent stretch reflexes during voluntary movement: A computational study"  DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.08.570843 

The Macaque_Arm_Codes_Data has all codes used to generate simulation data. It includes an MuJoCo xml file of the computational model of a Rhesus Macaque arm and its Geometry folder,  A MuJoCo-py controller codes for running the simulation for unmodulated reflex gain, alpha-gamma co-activation, and reflex gain scaled by the alpha drive to the muscle, a folder with muscle activation files, a matlab code to generate activation data from scratch.

Use the autorun.sh file ti run simulation. NOTE: You should change the path names in the controller code to match where you saved the downloaded "Macaque_Arm_Codes_Data folder".  

A link to MATLAB Files will be added for those who wish to generate all plots used in the paper without running the simulation.
