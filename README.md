These are supplementary codes for "An α-MN collateral to γ-MNs can mitigate velocity-dependent stretch reflexes during voluntary movement: A computational study"  paper. See https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.08.570843

The provided codes include an MuJoCo xml file of the computational model of a Rhesus Macaque arm and its Geometry folder, MuJoCo-py controller codes for running the simulation for unmodulated reflex gain, alpha-gamma co-activation, and reflex gain scaled by the alpha drive to the muscle, a matlab code to generate feedforward muscle activation files.

Use the autorun.sh file to run simulation. NOTE: You should change the path in controller codes to match where you saved the downloaded "Macaque_Arm_Codes_Data folder".
